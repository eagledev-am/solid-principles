# Dependency Inversion Principle
```
High level module should not depend on low level module but should depend on interfaces instead
```
#
Class should depend on interfaces instead of concrete class
#
* ## High level module
  The class which use an instance of another class
* ## Low Level module
  The class which used in another class
