# Dependency Inversion Principle
```
High level module should not depend on low level module but should depend on interfaces instead
```
#
Class should depend on interfaces instead of concrete class
#
* ## High level module
  high-level module is a module (class) that uses other modules (classes) to perform a task. A low-level module contains a detailed implementation of some specific task that can be used by other modules
